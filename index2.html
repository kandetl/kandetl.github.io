      <p>Welcome to the home page, the page that stands as home for this GameMentors site. As with the previous page, this page will tell utterly nothing of what GameMentors is about. This is most certainly not an  introduction. That is what it is supposed to be though.</p>

    <h4>Event1</h4>
    <p>The event in the beginning. you know, the one that starts stuff. There's gonna be cookies, soda, candy, and all those  other fun things. Brocolli too I guess.</p>
    <h4>Event2</h4>
      <p>This is the second event. you know, the one that after the first. There's gonna be cookies, soda, candy, and all those  other fun things. Brocolli too I guess.</p>
    <h4>Event3</h4>
      <p>This is the third event. By now, some of you won't come anymore. There will still be cookies, soda, candy, and all those  other fun things. Brocolli too I guess.</p>
    <h4>Event4</h4>
      <p>This is the fourth event. There's gonna be cookies, soda, candy, and all those  other fun things. Brocolli too I guess.</p>
    <h4>Event5</h4>
      <p>Are people still coming to these things? I mean we still got cookies and stuff. We ran out of Brocolli though. Odd.</p>
    <h4>Event6</h4>
      <p>Wow you're still here? We ran out of all the good stuff, so I'm not sure why you're still hanging around, you should probably go home now.</p>
    <h4>Event7</h4>
     <p>Uh, I'm calling the cops.</p>

    <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
    <p>*shrugs* I don't know anything about these guys. I'm guessing this is supposed to be a big brother/big sister project for kids where they play video games together and stuff. They ran out of funding though.</p>
